                <h2>Software Experience:</h2>
                <p>My experience with software started when I got my first computer. I learned all about windows and the cool things you could do inside and how to navigate it very well. One important thing I learned in high school was all of the microsoft services. I earned certifications in most services and am very good at doing advanced work in most of their services. Most notably, Excel, Word, and Powerpoint.</p>

                <h2>Projects:</h2>
                <p>Some projects I had in high school included some very challenging exams in every microsoft service to ensure I was fit to achieve a certificate from them. One of my proudest achievements is that I achieved a perfect score on the Excel expert exam, which was never seen before at my high school. Now that I am in college I am learning more advanced things, some of them being python, html, css, and mysql. I hope to one day be extremely good at python as it is my favorite language to learn right now.</p>

                <h2>Skills Used:</h2>
                <p>The skills I used in my coding and software experience is advanced problem solving and extremely hard work. College really isn't easy and learning multiple coding languages as well as deepening my understanding in other topics makes it very hard to learn in the ways I'd want to learn. Learning so many languages at once is difficult but also extremely fun and I love challenging myself to see what I am capable of.</p>
