                <h2>My Skills:</h2>
                <p class="information">I've been working with computers since I was 10 years old. I built my first computer when I was 12 and loved every part about learning what each piece of hardware did and why it was so important for the computer to have each piece in it's proper place. My knowlege of hardware combined with my strong knowlege of software makes me very quick at navigating complex computer software such as Excel and Word which is extremely useful is professional context.</p>

                <h2>My Education:</h2>
                <p class="information">All throughout high school I had a problem focusing on some classes because I was so involved in what I had going on at home with my computer projects. My friend and I always used to talk to eachother about different things we could do with the computers they gave us for school and ways we could make the experience better for our school use. I graduated high school with a very wide range of knowledge on chromebooks as well as a deeper understanding of hardware as that is when I built my second computer. I came to college wanting to deeper my understanding more on software than hardware because I want to know the inner workings of computers more and languages such as python.</p>

                <h2>Work Experience:</h2>
                <p class="information">My work experience is lacking in the computer field as I haven't had the ability to go into anything involving much technology yet. My experience so far consists of Domino's pizza and Marco's pizza. The experience for me at these places wasn't the best but it did bring me a better understanding of customer service as well as working with a team extremely well. I made a lot of really good friends working at these places and am very happy I decided to work there as a high school job. I learned so much about how to take care of customers and amazing problem solving skills.</p>
